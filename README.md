An interactive website that emulates a drum kit, allowing users to play various drum sounds by clicking buttons or pressing specific keys on the keyboard. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project features a visually engaging interface with styled buttons representing different drum sounds. Each button is associated with a unique drum image and plays a corresponding audio file when clicked or when the relevant key is pressed. The design includes responsive styling and user feedback elements to enhance the overall experience.
